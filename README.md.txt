[ Readme ]
Each file, for the purposes of confidentiality has been scrubbed of identifying information.

E.g:
Public-SmartReaderData\01\ contains copied data for building 01
Public-SmartReaderData\02\ contains copied data for building 02

[ Notes ]
A list containing that reference number will be shared. Consult that list to determine
what building corresponds to which of these data.

In addition, in each building sub-directory there will be a readme file containing the state of the data and
an associated metadata entry containing pertinent information regarding the processed copy of the data.

Those two files will be README.md and a file using the format of YYYY_MM_DD_BLDG_##_METADATA.txt

[ Naming Convention for files ]
In addition, a file naming convention is used to keep the records manageable: YYYY_MM_DD_BLDG_##.csv

E.g
2019_01_24_BLDG_01.csv would be a collection event for that building that occurred on that day.
